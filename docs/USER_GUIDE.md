# User Guide

← [Back to README](../README.md)

> **Credit:** The TUI interface, views, and all features described here were originally designed and implemented by [@Dicklesworthstone](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone) in [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer). Beadwork is a community fork that builds on this foundation.

## 💡 TL;DR

`bw` is a high-performance **Terminal User Interface (TUI)** for browsing and managing tasks in projects that use the **Beads** issue tracking system. 

**Why you'd care:**
*   **Speed:** Browse thousands of issues instantly with zero network latency.
*   **Focus:** Stay in your terminal and use Vim-style keys (`j`/`k`) to navigate.
*   **Intelligence:** It visualizes your project as a **dependency graph**, automatically highlighting bottlenecks, cycles, and critical paths that traditional list-based trackers miss.
*   **AI-Ready:** It provides structured, pre-computed insights for AI coding agents, acting as a "brain" for your project's task management.

---

## 📖 The Core Experience

At its heart, `bw` is about **viewing your work nicely**.

### ⚡ Fast, Fluid Browsing
No web page loads, no heavy clients. `bw` starts instantly and lets you fly through your issue backlog using standard Vim keys (`j`/`k`).
*   **Split-View Dashboard:** On wider screens, see your list on the left and full details on the right.
*   **Markdown Rendering:** Issue descriptions, comments, and notes are beautifully rendered with syntax highlighting, headers, and lists.
*   **Instant Filtering:** Zero-latency filtering. Press `o` for Open, `c` for Closed, or `r` for Ready (unblocked) tasks.
*   **Live Reload:** Watches `.beads/beads.jsonl` and refreshes lists, details, and insights automatically when the file changes—no restart needed.

### 🔎 Rich Context
Don't just read the title. `bw` gives you the full picture:
*   **Comments & History:** Scroll through the full conversation history of any task.
*   **Metadata:** Instantly see Assignees, Labels, Priority badges, and creation dates.
*   **Search:** Powerful fuzzy search (`/`) finds issues by ID, title, or content instantly.

### 🎯 Focused Workflows
*   **Kanban Board:** Press `b` to switch to a columnar view (Open, In Progress, Blocked, Closed) to visualize flow.
*   **Visual Graph:** Press `g` to explore the dependency tree visually.
*   **Insights:** Press `i` to see graph metrics and bottlenecks.
*   **History View:** Press `h` to see the timeline of changes, correlating git commits with bead modifications. On wider terminals, enjoy a responsive three-pane layout showing commits, affected beads, and details.
*   **Ultra-Wide Mode:** On large monitors, the list expands to show extra columns like sparklines and label tags.

### 🛠️ Quick Actions
*   **Export:** Press `E` to export all issues to a timestamped Markdown file with Mermaid diagrams.
*   **Graph Export (CLI):** `bw --robot-graph` outputs the dependency graph as JSON, DOT (Graphviz), or Mermaid format. Use `--graph-format=dot` for rendering with Graphviz, or `--graph-root=ID --graph-depth=3` to extract focused subgraphs.
*   **Copy:** Press `C` to copy the selected issue as formatted Markdown to your clipboard.
*   **Edit:** Press `O` to open the `.beads/beads.jsonl` file in your preferred GUI editor.
*   **Time-Travel:** Press `t` to compare against any git revision, or `T` for quick HEAD~5 comparison. Combined with History view (`h`), you can navigate to any commit and see exactly what changed.

### 🔌 Automation Hooks
Configure pre- and post-export hooks in `.bv/hooks.yaml` to run validations, notifications, or uploads. Defaults: pre-export hooks fail fast on errors (`on_error: fail`), post-export hooks log and continue (`on_error: continue`). Empty commands are ignored with a warning for safety. Hook env includes `BW_EXPORT_PATH`, `BW_EXPORT_FORMAT`, `BW_ISSUE_COUNT`, `BW_TIMESTAMP`, plus any custom `env` entries.

---
## 📸 Graph Export (`--robot-graph`)

Export the dependency graph in multiple formats for visualization, documentation, or integration with other tools:

```bash
bw --robot-graph                              # JSON (default)
bw --robot-graph --graph-format=dot           # Graphviz DOT
bw --robot-graph --graph-format=mermaid       # Mermaid diagram

# Focused subgraph extraction
bw --robot-graph --graph-root=bv-123          # Subgraph from specific root
bw --robot-graph --graph-root=bv-123 --graph-depth=3  # Limited depth
```

### Output Formats

| Format | Use Case | Rendering |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| `json` | Programmatic processing, custom visualization | Parse with jq or code |
| `dot` | High-quality static images | `dot -Tpng file.dot -o graph.png` |
| `mermaid` | Embed in Markdown, GitHub rendering | Paste into docs |

### Subgraph Extraction

For large projects, extract focused views around specific issues:

- **`--graph-root=ID`**: Start from a specific issue and include all its dependencies and dependents
- **`--graph-depth=N`**: Limit traversal to N levels (0 = unlimited)

### JSON Schema

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "bv-123", "title": "Fix auth", "status": "open", "priority": 1 }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "from": "bv-124", "to": "bv-123", "type": "blocks" }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "data_hash": "abc123",
    "node_count": 45,
    "edge_count": 62
  }
}
```

## 🌌 Interactive Graph Visualization (`--export-graph`)

For deep exploration of complex dependency structures, `bw` generates **self-contained HTML visualizations** powered by a force-directed graph engine. Unlike static exports, these are fully interactive—pan, zoom, filter, and drill into individual beads without any server or dependencies.

```bash
# Generate interactive HTML graph
bw --export-graph graph.html                    # Export to specific file
bw --export-graph                               # Auto-generate timestamped filename
bw --export-graph --graph-title "Q4 Sprint"     # Custom title
bw --export-graph --graph-include-closed        # Include closed issues
```

### Why Interactive Graph Visualization?

Traditional list-based views show tasks in isolation. The interactive graph reveals the **hidden structure** of your project:

- **Dependency Chains**: See at a glance which tasks are blocking others, and trace critical paths through your backlog
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Nodes sized by PageRank/betweenness instantly reveal which items have outsized impact
- **Cluster Discovery**: Force-directed layout naturally groups related work, exposing team boundaries or feature clusters
- **Context Switching**: Hover over any node to see full details—description, design notes, acceptance criteria—without leaving the visualization

### What's Included in the Export

Each HTML file is **completely self-contained** (typically 400KB-1MB depending on project size):

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Full Bead Data** | Title, description, design, acceptance criteria, notes, labels, timestamps |
| **Graph Metrics** | PageRank, betweenness, critical path score, slack, hub/authority scores |
| **Triage Analysis** | Complete triage recommendations with scores and reasons |
| **Git Correlation** | Commit history linked to each bead (when available) |
| **Dependency Map** | Full blocked-by/blocks relationships with visual edges |

### Interface Overview

The visualization provides a rich, keyboard-driven interface:

### Visual Encoding

Nodes encode multiple dimensions of information simultaneously:

| Visual Property | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Color** | Status: 🟢 Open, 🟠 In Progress, 🔴 Blocked, ⚫ Closed |
| **Size** | Configurable metric (PageRank, betweenness, critical path, in-degree) |
| **Shape** | Type: ● Feature, ▲ Bug, ■ Task, ◆ Epic |
| **Glow** | Golden halo on hover shows connected subgraph (2-hop neighbors) |

- **Performance**: Handles 500+ nodes smoothly with WebGL-accelerated rendering
- **File Size**: Typically 400KB-1MB depending on project size and content

## 📄 The Status Report Engine

`bw` isn't just for personal browsing; it's a communication tool. The `--export-md` flag generates a **Management-Ready Status Report** that converts your repo state into a polished document suitable for stakeholders.

### 1. The "Hybrid Document" Architecture
The exporter (`pkg/export/markdown.go`) constructs a document that bridges human readability and visual data:
*   **Summary at a Glance:** Top-level statistics (Total, Open, Blocked, Closed) give immediate health context.
*   **Embedded Graph:** It injects the full dependency graph as a Mermaid diagram *right into the document*. On platforms like GitHub or GitLab, this renders as an interactive chart.
*   **Anchor Navigation:** A generated Table of Contents uses URL-friendly slugs (`#core-123-refactor-login`) to link directly to specific issue details, allowing readers to jump between the high-level graph and low-level specs.

### 2. Semantic Formatting
We don't just dump JSON values. The exporter applies specific formatting rules to ensure the report looks professional:
*   **Metadata Tables:** Key fields (Assignee, Priority, Status) are aligned in GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) tables with emoji indicators.
*   **Conversation threading:** Comments are rendered as blockquotes (`>`) with relative timestamps, preserving the flow of discussion distinct from the technical spec.
*   **Intelligent Sorting:** The report doesn't list issues ID-sequentially. It applies the same priority logic as the TUI: **Open Critical** issues appear first, ensuring the reader focuses on what matters now.

## ⏳ Time-Travel: Snapshot Diffing & Git History

One of `bw`'s most powerful capabilities is **Time-Travel**—the ability to compare your project's state across any two points in git history. This transforms `bw` from a "viewer" into a **progress tracking and regression detection system**.

### The Snapshot Model
`bw` captures the complete state of your project at any moment:

```mermaid
graph LR
    %%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#e8f5e9', 'primaryTextColor': '#2e7d32', 'primaryBorderColor': '#81c784', 'lineColor': '#90a4ae'}}}%%

    subgraph "Git History"
        A["HEAD~10<br/><small>10 commits ago</small>"]
        B["HEAD~5<br/><small>5 commits ago</small>"]
        C["HEAD<br/><small>Current</small>"]
    end

    subgraph "Snapshots"
        D["Snapshot A<br/><small>45 issues, 3 cycles</small>"]
        E["Snapshot B<br/><small>52 issues, 1 cycle</small>"]
        F["Snapshot C<br/><small>58 issues, 0 cycles</small>"]
    end

    A --> D
    B --> E
    C --> F
    D -.->|"diff"| E
    E -.->|"diff"| F

    style D fill:#ffcdd2,stroke:#e57373,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#ffb74d,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#c8e6c9,stroke:#81c784,stroke-width:2px
```

### What Gets Tracked
The `SnapshotDiff` captures every meaningful change:

| Category | Tracked Changes |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Issues** | New, Closed, Reopened, Removed, Modified |
| **Fields** | Title, Status, Priority, Tags, Dependencies |
| **Graph** | New Cycles, Resolved Cycles |
| **Metrics** | Δ PageRank, Δ Betweenness, Δ Density |

### Git History Integration (`pkg/loader/git.go`)
The `GitLoader` enables loading issues from **any git revision**:

```go
loader := NewGitLoader("/path/to/repo")

// Load from various references
current, _ := loader.LoadAt("HEAD")
lastWeek, _ := loader.LoadAt("HEAD~7")
release, _ := loader.LoadAt("v1.0.0")
byDate, _ := loader.LoadAt("main@{2024-01-15}")
```

**Cache Architecture:**
- Revisions are resolved to commit SHAs for stable caching
- Thread-safe `sync.RWMutex` protects concurrent access
- 5-minute TTL prevents stale data while avoiding redundant git calls

### Use Cases
1. **Sprint Retrospectives:** "How many issues did we close this sprint?"
2. **Regression Detection:** "Did we accidentally reintroduce a dependency cycle?"
3. **Trend Analysis:** "Is our graph density increasing? Are we creating too many dependencies?"
4. **Release Notes:** "Generate a diff of all changes between v1.0 and v2.0"

## 🍳 Recipe System: Declarative View Configuration

Instead of memorizing CLI flags or repeatedly setting filters, `bw` supports **Recipes**—YAML-based view configurations that can be saved, shared, and version-controlled.

### Recipe Structure
```yaml
# .beads/recipes/sprint-review.yaml
name: sprint-review
description: "Issues touched in the current sprint"

filters:
  status: [open, in_progress, closed]
  updated_after: "14d"              # Relative time: 14 days ago
  exclude_tags: [backlog, icebox]

sort:
  field: updated
  direction: desc
  secondary:
    field: priority
    direction: asc

view:
  columns: [id, title, status, priority, updated]
  show_metrics: true
  max_items: 50

export:
  format: markdown
  include_graph: true
```

### Filter Capabilities

| Filter | Type | Examples |
|--------|------|----------|
| `status` | Array | `[open, closed, blocked, in_progress]` |
| `priority` | Array | `[0, 1]` (P0 and P1 only) |
| `tags` | Array | `[frontend, urgent]` |
| `exclude_tags` | Array | `[wontfix, duplicate]` |
| `created_after` | Relative/ISO | `"7d"`, `"2w"`, `"2024-01-01"` |
| `updated_before` | Relative/ISO | `"30d"`, `"1m"` |
| `actionable` | Boolean | `true` = no open blockers |
| `has_blockers` | Boolean | `true` = waiting on dependencies |
| `id_prefix` | String | `"bv-"` for project filtering |
| `title_contains` | String | Substring search |

### Built-in Recipes
`bw` ships with 11 pre-configured recipes:

| Recipe | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `default` | All open issues sorted by priority |
| `actionable` | Ready to work (no blockers) |
| `recent` | Updated in last 7 days |
| `blocked` | Waiting on dependencies |
| `high-impact` | Top PageRank scores |
| `stale` | Open but untouched for 30+ days |
| `triage` | Sorted by computed triage score (impact + unblocking potential) |
| `closed` | Recently closed issues |
| `release-cut` | Closed in last 14 days (for changelog generation) |
| `quick-wins` | Easy P2/P3 items with no blockers |
| `bottlenecks` | High betweenness nodes (project bottlenecks) |

### Using Recipes
```bash
# Interactive picker (press 'R' in TUI)
bw

# Direct recipe invocation
bw --recipe actionable
bw --recipe high-impact

# Custom recipe file
bw --recipe .beads/recipes/sprint-review.yaml
```

---

## 🎯 Composite Impact Scoring

Traditional issue trackers sort by a single dimension—usually priority. `bw` computes a **multi-factor Impact Score** that blends graph-theoretic metrics with temporal and priority signals.

### The Scoring Formula
$$
\text{Impact} = 0.30 \cdot \text{PageRank} + 0.30 \cdot \text{Betweenness} + 0.20 \cdot \text{BlockerRatio} + 0.10 \cdot \text{Staleness} + 0.10 \cdot \text{PriorityBoost}
$$

### Component Breakdown

| Component | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **PageRank** | 30% | Recursive dependency importance |
| **Betweenness** | 30% | Bottleneck/bridge position |
| **BlockerRatio** | 20% | Direct dependents (In-Degree) |
| **Staleness** | 10% | Days since last update (aging) |
| **PriorityBoost** | 10% | Human-assigned priority |

### Why These Weights?
- **60% Graph Metrics:** The structure of dependencies is the primary driver of true importance.
- **20% Blocker Ratio:** Direct dependents matter for immediate unblocking.
- **10% Staleness:** Old issues deserve attention; they may be forgotten blockers.
- **10% Priority:** Human judgment is valuable but can be outdated or politically biased.

### Score Output
```json
{
  "issue_id": "CORE-123",
  "title": "Refactor auth module",
  "score": 0.847,
  "breakdown": {
    "pagerank": 0.27,
    "betweenness": 0.25,
    "blocker_ratio": 0.18,
    "staleness": 0.07,
    "priority_boost": 0.08
  }
}
```

### Priority Recommendations
`bw` generates **actionable recommendations** when the computed impact score diverges significantly from the human-assigned priority:

> ⚠️ **CORE-123** has Impact Score 0.85 but Priority P3.
> *Reason: High PageRank (foundational dependency) + High Betweenness (bottleneck)*
> **Recommendation:** Consider escalating to P1.

### Priority Hints Overlay

Press `p` in the list view to toggle **Priority Hints**—inline visual indicators showing which issues have misaligned priorities:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  OPEN     CORE-123 ⬆ Database schema migration       P3  🟢 │
│  OPEN     UI-456     Login page styling              P2  🟢 │
│  BLOCKED  API-789  ⬇ Legacy endpoint wrapper         P1  🔴 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        ⬆ = Impact suggests higher priority (red arrow)
        ⬇ = Impact suggests lower priority (teal arrow)
```

This provides at-a-glance feedback on whether your priority assignments match the computed graph importance.

---

## 🛤️ Parallel Execution Planning

When you ask "What should I work on next?", `bw` doesn't just pick the highest-priority item. It generates a **complete execution plan** that respects dependencies and identifies opportunities for parallel work.

### Track-Based Planning
The planner uses **Union-Find** to identify connected components in the dependency graph, grouping related issues into independent "tracks" that can be worked on concurrently.

```mermaid
graph TD
    %%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#e8f5e9', 'lineColor': '#90a4ae'}}}%%

    subgraph track_a ["🅰️ Track A: Auth System"]
        A1["AUTH-001<br/>P1 · Unblocks 3"]:::actionable
        A2["AUTH-002"]:::blocked
        A3["AUTH-003"]:::blocked
    end

    subgraph track_b ["🅱️ Track B: UI Polish"]
        B1["UI-101<br/>P2 · Unblocks 1"]:::actionable
        B2["UI-102"]:::blocked
    end

    subgraph track_c ["🅲 Track C: Independent"]
        C1["DOCS-001<br/>P3 · Unblocks 0"]:::actionable
    end

    A1 --> A2
    A2 --> A3
    B1 --> B2

    classDef actionable fill:#c8e6c9,stroke:#81c784,stroke-width:2px,color:#2e7d32
    classDef blocked fill:#ffcdd2,stroke:#e57373,stroke-width:2px,color:#c62828

    linkStyle 0,1,2 stroke:#81c784,stroke-width:2px
```

### Plan Output (`--robot-plan`)
```json
{
  "tracks": [
    {
      "track_id": "track-A",
      "reason": "Independent work stream",
      "items": [
        { "id": "AUTH-001", "priority": 1, "unblocks": ["AUTH-002", "AUTH-003", "API-005"] }
      ]
    },
    {
      "track_id": "track-B",
      "reason": "Independent work stream",
      "items": [
        { "id": "UI-101", "priority": 2, "unblocks": ["UI-102"] }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "total_actionable": 3,
  "total_blocked": 5,
  "summary": {
    "highest_impact": "AUTH-001",
    "impact_reason": "Unblocks 3 tasks",
    "unblocks_count": 3
  }
}
```

### The Algorithm
1. **Identify Actionable Issues:** Filter to non-closed issues with no open blockers.
2. **Compute Unblocks:** For each actionable issue, calculate what becomes unblocked if it's completed.
3. **Find Connected Components:** Use Union-Find to group issues by their dependency relationships.
4. **Build Tracks:** Create parallel tracks from each component, sorted by priority within each track.
5. **Compute Summary:** Identify the single highest-impact issue (most downstream unblocks).

### Benefits for AI Agents
- **Deterministic:** Same input always produces same plan (no LLM hallucination).
- **Parallelism-Aware:** Multiple agents can grab different tracks without conflicts.
- **Impact-Ranked:** The `highest_impact` field tells agents exactly where to start.

### The Detail Panel: Calculation Proofs

When you select a bead, the right-side **Detail Panel** shows not just the score, but the *proof*—the actual beads and values that contributed:

```
─── CALCULATION PROOF ───
BW(v) = Σ (σst(v) / σst) for all s≠v≠t

Betweenness Score: 0.452

Beads depending on this (5):
  ↓ UI-Login: Implement login form
  ↓ UI-Dashboard: User dashboard
  ↓ API-Auth: Authentication endpoint
  ... +2 more

This depends on (2):
  ↑ DB-Schema: User table migration
  ↑ CORE-Config: Environment setup

This bead lies on many shortest paths between
other beads, making it a critical junction.
```

## 📋 Kanban Board: Visual Workflow State

The Kanban Board (`b`) provides a **columnar workflow view** with intelligent swimlane grouping, visual dependency indicators, and rich card details. Empty columns automatically collapse to maximize screen real estate.

### Swimlane Grouping Modes

Press `s` to cycle through three grouping modes:

| Mode | Columns | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Status** (default) | Open \| In Progress \| Blocked \| Closed | Workflow state tracking |
| **Priority** | P0 Critical \| P1 High \| P2 Medium \| P3+ Other | Urgency-based triage |
| **Type** | Bug \| Feature \| Task \| Epic | Work categorization |

The current mode is shown in the status bar. Each mode uses distinct column colors for quick visual identification.

### Visual Dependency Indicators

Card borders are **color-coded** to show dependency status at a glance:

```
┌─ 🔴 RED ──────────────────┐    ┌─ 🟡 YELLOW ─────────────────┐
│ BLOCKED                    │    │ HIGH-IMPACT                  │

## 🔄 List Sorting: Multi-Dimensional Organization

Press `s` to cycle through **five distinct sort modes**, giving you instant control over how issues are organized. The current sort mode is displayed in the status bar.

### Sort Modes

| Mode | Key Display | Ordering Logic | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Default** | `Default` | Priority (asc) → Created (desc) | Standard priority-driven workflow |
| **Created ↑** | `Created ↑` | Creation date ascending (oldest first) | Audit: find long-standing issues |
| **Created ↓** | `Created ↓` | Creation date descending (newest first) | Review: see recently created work |
| **Priority** | `Priority` | Priority only (P0 → P4) | Pure priority triage |
| **Updated** | `Updated` | Last update descending (newest first) | Activity tracking: see active issues |

### Design Philosophy

The sort system uses a **stable secondary sort** to ensure deterministic ordering. When primary sort values are equal, issues fall back to ID ordering for consistency across sessions. This prevents the "shuffling list" problem where equal-priority items randomly reorder.

### Status Bar Indicator

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📋 ISSUES                                    [Created ↓]  │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  OPEN   FEAT-789  Add dark mode toggle           P2  🟢   │
│  OPEN   BUG-456   Fix login race condition       P1  🟢   │
│  OPEN   TASK-123  Update documentation           P3  🟢   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The `[Created ↓]` badge instantly communicates the active sort mode without requiring you to remember which mode you're in.

## 🌲 Hierarchical Tree View: Parent-Child Visualization

Press `E` to open the **Hierarchical Tree View**—a collapsible tree that visualizes parent-child relationships between issues. Unlike the Graph View which shows all dependency types, the Tree View focuses exclusively on **structural hierarchy**: which issues are "part of" other issues.

### Why Parent-Child Matters

In complex projects, issues often have two distinct relationship types:
- **Blocking dependencies** (`blocks`/`blocked_by`): Task B cannot start until Task A completes
- **Parent-child relationships** (`parent`): Feature X contains Tasks A, B, and C as sub-work

The Tree View renders only parent-child relationships, creating a work breakdown structure (WBS) that answers questions like:
- "What sub-tasks make up this epic?"
- "Which feature does this bug belong to?"
- "How is work decomposed across the project?"

### Tree Layout

### Visual Encoding

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **▾ / ▸** | Expanded / Collapsed (has children) |
| **•** | Leaf node (no children) |
| **├─ / └─** | Tree branch connectors |
| **Type Icon** | 🎯 Epic, ✨ Feature, 🐛 Bug, 📝 Task, 🔧 Chore |
| **Priority** | P0 (critical red), P1 (high), P2 (medium gray), P3+ (muted) |
| **Status Dot** | ● Open (green), ◐ In Progress (yellow), ⚠ Blocked (red), ○ Closed (gray) |

### Tree Building Algorithm

The tree construction uses a **parent-child only** filter with intelligent root detection:

1. **Filter Dependencies**: Only `DepParentChild` type dependencies are considered; blocking and related dependencies are ignored
2. **Build Index**: Create a parent → children mapping for efficient traversal
3. **Identify Roots**: Issues with no parent (or whose parent doesn't exist in the dataset) become root nodes
4. **Recursive Build**: Depth-first traversal with cycle detection prevents infinite loops
5. **Sort Children**: Within each parent, children are sorted by: Priority (ascending) → Type (epic > feature > bug > task) → Creation Date (newest first)

**Handling Edge Cases:**
- **Orphan References**: If an issue references a parent that doesn't exist, it becomes a root node (not silently dropped)
- **Cycles**: Detected during traversal; cyclic nodes are rendered without recursing further
- **Deep Hierarchies**: No depth limit—the tree faithfully represents arbitrarily nested structures

### Tree Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Movement** | |
| `j` / `k` / `↓` / `↑` | Move cursor down / up |
| `g` / `G` | Jump to first / last node |
| `Ctrl+D` / `Ctrl+U` | Page down / up (half viewport) |
| **Expand/Collapse** | |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Toggle expand/collapse on current node |
| `l` / `→` | Expand node, or move to first child if already expanded |
| `h` / `←` | Collapse node, or jump to parent if already collapsed |
| `o` | Expand all nodes in the tree |
| `O` | Collapse all nodes in the tree |
| **Integration** | |
| `Tab` | Sync selection to detail panel (in split view) |
| `E` / `Esc` | Exit tree view, return to list |

### Use Cases

| Scenario | How Tree View Helps |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Sprint Planning** | Expand epics to see all sub-work and estimate scope |
| **Progress Tracking** | Collapse completed branches, focus on open work |
| **Onboarding** | New team members understand project structure at a glance |
| **Refactoring** | See which tasks fall under a feature before restructuring |
| **Status Meetings** | Walk through the hierarchy top-down for stakeholder updates |

### Tree vs. Graph View

| Aspect | Tree View (`E`) | Graph View (`g`) |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Relationships** | Parent-child only | All dependency types |
| **Layout** | Indented hierarchy | Force-directed / DAG |
| **Focus** | Work breakdown structure | Dependency flow |
| **Navigation** | Vim-style (j/k/h/l) | Viewport panning |
| **Best For** | "What's inside this epic?" | "What blocks this task?" |

Both views complement each other: use Tree View to understand structure, Graph View to understand flow.

## 🎯 Actionable Plan View: Parallel Execution Tracks

Press `a` to open the **Actionable Plan View**—a structured display of work items grouped into independent execution tracks. This view transforms abstract graph analysis into a concrete "what to work on next" interface.

### Why Tracks Matter

Traditional priority lists show tasks in a single ordered queue. But in complex dependency graphs, some work streams are completely independent—working on one doesn't affect another. The Actionable Plan View identifies these **parallel tracks** using Union-Find connected component analysis, letting multiple agents or team members work concurrently without stepping on each other.

### Visual Layout

```

### What Makes an Item "Actionable"

An issue appears in the Actionable Plan when:
1. **Status is open or in_progress** (not closed)
2. **No open blockers** exist (all blocking dependencies are closed)

This ensures every item in the view can be started immediately without waiting on anything else.

### Unblock Analysis

Each item shows an **unblocks count**—the number of other issues that would become actionable if this item were completed. High unblock counts indicate **force multipliers**: completing them unlocks a cascade of downstream work.

The **Highest Impact** summary at the bottom identifies the single item that, when completed, unblocks the most additional work. This is your optimal "next thing to pick up."

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Move between items (across tracks) |
| `Enter` | Focus selected item in detail view |
| `a` / `Esc` | Exit actionable view |

### Use Cases

| Scenario | How Actionable View Helps |
|----------|---------------------------|
| **Solo Development** | Always know the highest-impact next task |
| **Team Standup** | Each person claims a different track |
| **AI Agent Dispatch** | Agents grab `highest_impact` deterministically |
| **Sprint Planning** | Estimate work by counting actionable items per track |

## 🔀 Flow Matrix View: Cross-Label Dependency Analysis

Press `f` to open the **Flow Matrix View**—an interactive dashboard visualizing how labels (domains/teams) depend on each other. This reveals cross-team bottlenecks that aren't visible in single-issue views.

### Why Cross-Label Flow Matters

In large projects, work is often organized by labels: `frontend`, `backend`, `api`, `auth`, `infra`. Dependencies between issues create implicit dependencies between *labels*. The Flow Matrix exposes these patterns:

- **Which team is blocking others the most?**
- **Which domain is waiting on the most external work?**
- **Where are the cross-team coordination bottlenecks?**

### Visual Layout

```

### Bottleneck Score

The bottleneck score (0.0–1.0) measures how much a label blocks cross-domain work:

$$
\text{Bottleneck} = \frac{\text{Outgoing Deps}}{\text{Total Cross-Label Deps}} \times \text{Criticality Weight}
$$

| Score | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0.7 – 1.0 | 🔴 Red | Critical bottleneck—prioritize unblocking |
| 0.4 – 0.7 | 🟡 Yellow | Moderate blocking—monitor closely |
| 0.0 – 0.4 | 🟢 Green | Healthy flow—no coordination issues |

### Drilldown Mode

Press `Enter` on a label to drill down into the specific issues creating cross-label dependencies:

## 🎪 Attention View: Label Priority Ranking

Press `]` to open the **Attention View**—a ranked table of labels by attention score, helping you identify which project areas need focus.

### Attention Score Formula

The attention score combines multiple signals to surface neglected or problematic areas:

$$
\text{Attention} = \frac{\text{PageRank}_{\text{avg}} \times \text{Staleness} \times \text{BlockImpact}}{\text{Velocity} + \epsilon}
$$

| Component | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| **PageRank (avg)** | Average importance of issues in this label |
| **Staleness** | How long since issues were updated (higher = more stale) |
| **Block Impact** | How many issues are blocked within this label |
| **Velocity** | Completion rate (issues closed per week) |

High attention scores indicate labels that are both important and neglected—they need intervention.

### Interpreting Results

- **High Attention + Low Velocity**: Area is stuck—investigate blockers
- **High Attention + High Stale**: Work forgotten—resurface and reprioritize
- **Low Attention + High Velocity**: Healthy area—keep momentum
- **High Blocked Count**: Dependencies creating bottleneck

## 📜 History View: Bead-to-Commit Correlation

Press `h` to open the **History View**—an interactive timeline that correlates beads with their related git commits. This bridges the gap between "what work was planned" and "what code was actually written."

### The Correlation Engine

The `pkg/correlation` package implements a **multi-strategy correlation system** that infers relationships between beads and commits using several techniques:

```mermaid
graph TD
    %%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#e8f5e9', 'lineColor': '#90a4ae'}}}%%

    subgraph strategies ["🔍 Correlation Strategies"]
        E["Explicit Mentions<br/><small>Commit contains bead ID</small>"]
        T["Temporal Proximity<br/><small>Commit near bead events</small>"]
        C["Co-Commit Analysis<br/><small>Files changed together</small>"]
        P["Path Matching<br/><small>File paths match bead scope</small>"]
    end

    subgraph scorer ["📊 Confidence Scorer"]
        S["Multi-Factor Scoring<br/><small>Weighted combination</small>"]
    end

    subgraph output ["📈 Output"]
        H["BeadHistory<br/><small>Events + Commits + Milestones</small>"]
    end

    E --> S
    T --> S
    C --> S
    P --> S
    S --> H

    classDef strategy fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#90caf9,stroke-width:2px,color:#1565c0
    classDef score fill:#fff8e1,stroke:#ffcc80,stroke-width:2px,color:#e65100
    classDef out fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#a5d6a7,stroke-width:2px,color:#2e7d32

    class E,T,C,P strategy
    class S score
    class H out
```

### Correlation Strategies

| Strategy | Weight | How It Works |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| **Explicit Mentions** | High | Commit message contains bead ID (e.g., `fix(auth): resolve race condition [BV-123]`) |
| **Temporal Proximity** | Medium | Commit timestamp falls within bead's active lifecycle window |
| **Co-Commit Analysis** | Medium | Files frequently modified together suggest shared purpose |
| **Path Matching** | Low | File paths match bead's label scope (e.g., `pkg/auth/*` for `auth` label) |

### Confidence Scoring

Each correlation receives a **confidence score** (0.0–1.0) computed by:

$$
\text{Confidence} = w_1 \cdot \text{Explicit} + w_2 \cdot \text{Temporal} + w_3 \cdot \text{CoCommit} + w_4 \cdot \text{Path}
$$

Default weights: Explicit=0.5, Temporal=0.25, CoCommit=0.15, Path=0.10

### History View Layout

The History View uses a **responsive three-pane layout** that adapts to terminal width:

| Width | Layout |
|-------|--------|
| **< 100** | Single pane: List with inline details |
| **100-160** | Two panes: List + Detail |
| **> 160** | Three panes: List + Timeline + Detail |

**Wide Terminal (3-pane) Layout:**

### Timeline Panel (`t` Toggle)

Press `t` to show/hide the **Timeline Panel**—a visual density chart of project activity:

- **Vertical axis**: Time (newest at top)
- **Horizontal bars**: Activity density (commits per day)
- **Bar magnitude**: ▪ = 1-2, ▪▪ = 3-5, ▪▪▪ = 6-10, ▪▪▪▪ = 11+
- **Highlights**: Selected bead's commits are marked with `━`

Click or navigate to a date to filter the view to that time period.

### Causality Markers

Each bead-commit correlation shows its **detection method** as a visual marker:

| Marker | Meaning | Confidence |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **🎯 Direct** | Commit message explicitly mentions bead ID | High (0.8-1.0) |
| **🔗 Temporal** | Commit falls within bead's active lifecycle | Medium (0.4-0.7) |
| **📁 File** | Commit touches files associated with bead | Low (0.2-0.5) |

### View Modes

Press `v` to toggle between two view modes:

| Mode | Shows | Use Case |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Bead Mode** (default) | Beads grouped with their correlated commits | "What commits relate to this task?" |
| **Git Mode** | Commits chronologically with correlated beads | "What tasks did this commit touch?" |

### File-Centric Drill-Down (`f` Key)

Press `f` to switch to **File Mode**—a tree view of changed files grouped by directory:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

## 🔗 Correlation Analysis: Impact Network & Related Work

Beyond simple bead-to-commit correlation, `bw` provides **deep analysis** of how beads relate to each other through shared code changes. This helps identify hidden dependencies, find related work, and understand the true impact of changes.

### Impact Network Graph

The Impact Network visualizes **implicit relationships** between beads based on:

```mermaid
graph LR
    %%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#e3f2fd', 'lineColor': '#90a4ae'}}}%%

    subgraph connections ["🔗 Edge Types"]
        SC["Shared Commit<br/><small>Same commit touches both beads</small>"]
        SF["Shared File<br/><small>Both beads modify same files</small>"]
        DEP["Dependency<br/><small>Explicit blocker relationship</small>"]
    end

    classDef edge fill:#fff8e1,stroke:#ffcc80,stroke-width:2px
    class SC,SF,DEP edge
```

| Edge Type | Weight | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Shared Commit** | High | A single commit references both beads (strong coupling) |
| **Shared File** | Medium | Both beads touched the same source file |
| **Dependency** | Explicit | Direct blocking relationship from issue tracker |

### Network Clusters

`bw` automatically detects **clusters** of tightly-connected beads using community detection:

```

### File-to-Bead Lookup

Find all beads that have touched a specific file using `--robot-file-beads`:

```bash
bw --robot-file-beads pkg/ui/board.go
```

Returns beads sorted by recency with commit details:

```json
{
  "file_path": "pkg/ui/board.go",
  "total_beads": 21,
  "open_beads": [],
  "closed_beads": [
    {
      "bead_id": "bv-v67w",
      "title": "Board: Integration & Polish",
      "status": "closed",
      "commit_shas": ["abc123"],
      "last_touch": "2025-12-18T00:19:21-05:00",
      "total_changes": 17
    }
  ]
}
```

**Use cases:**
- **Code ownership**: "Who has worked on this file recently?"
- **Impact analysis**: "What work items are affected by this file?"
- **Bug investigation**: "What changes might have introduced this regression?"

### Orphan Commit Detection

Find commits that should be linked to beads but aren't using `--robot-orphans`:

```bash
bw --robot-orphans
```

Returns candidate commits with probable bead matches:

```json
{
  "stats": {
    "total_commits": 500,
    "correlated_count": 242,
    "orphan_count": 258,
    "orphan_ratio": 0.516
  },
  "candidates": [
    {
      "sha": "abc1234",
      "message": "feat: add auth caching",
      "suspicion_score": 100,
      "probable_beads": [
        {
          "bead_id": "bv-xyz",
          "confidence": 65,
          "reasons": ["touches file pkg/auth/cache.go", "same author worked on bead nearby"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Use cases:**
- **Hygiene**: Find commits that slipped through without proper linking
- **Audit**: Ensure all code changes are tracked to work items
- **Correlation improvement**: Train the system by confirming/rejecting suggestions

### Related Work Discovery

For any bead, `bw` can find **related work** across four dimensions:

| Relation Type | How Detected | Example |
|---------------|--------------|---------|
| **File Overlap** | Both beads modify same source files | "BV-123 and BV-456 both touch `session.go`" |
| **Commit Overlap** | Both beads referenced in same commit | "BV-123 and BV-456 fixed in commit `abc123`" |
| **Dependency Cluster** | Both in same tightly-connected subgraph | "BV-123 is in the Auth cluster with BV-456" |
| **Concurrent** | Active during the same time window | "BV-123 and BV-456 both worked on last week" |

Each relation includes a **relevance score** (0-100) indicating strength.

### Robot Commands

```bash
# Get the full impact network (use "all" for complete graph)
bw --robot-impact-network all

# Get subnetwork focused on specific bead (default depth=2, max=3)
bw --robot-impact-network bv-123 --network-depth 2

# Find related work for a bead
bw --robot-related bv-123

# Include closed beads in related work results
bw --robot-related bv-123 --related-include-closed

# Tune related work thresholds
bw --robot-related bv-123 --related-min-relevance 30 --related-max-results 20

# Analyze causal chain for a bead (timeline, blockers, insights)
bw --robot-causality bv-123

# Find beads that touched a file
bw --robot-file-beads pkg/auth/session.go

# Find orphan commits (unlinked to beads)
bw --robot-orphans
```

### Causal Chain Analysis

The `--robot-causality` command reveals **why a bead took as long as it did** by reconstructing its timeline of events:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `created` | Bead was opened |
| `claimed` | Work started (status → in_progress) |
| `commit` | Code commit linked to bead |
| `blocked` | Bead became blocked by another bead |
| `unblocked` | Blocking dependency was resolved |
| `closed` | Bead was completed |
| `reopened` | Bead was reopened after closure |

**Insights provided:**
- **Blocked percentage**: How much time was spent waiting on dependencies
- **Critical path**: The chain of events determining minimum completion time
- **Longest gap**: Identifies stalled periods needing investigation
- **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions (e.g., "Consider breaking into smaller beads")

**Causality Output Schema:**
```json

  }
}
```

### Correlation Feedback System

Train the correlation engine by confirming or rejecting its suggestions:

```bash
# Explain why a correlation exists
bw --robot-explain-correlation abc1234:bv-xyz

# Confirm a correct correlation (boosts confidence)
bw --robot-confirm-correlation abc1234:bv-xyz

# Reject an incorrect correlation (removes it)
bw --robot-reject-correlation abc1234:bv-xyz

# View feedback statistics
bw --robot-correlation-stats
```

**Feedback Stats Output:**
```json
{
  "total_feedback": 15,
  "confirmed": 12,
  "rejected": 3,
  "accuracy_rate": 0.80,
  "avg_confirm_conf": 0.85,
  "avg_reject_conf": 0.42
}
```

This feedback loop improves correlation accuracy over time—confirmed correlations strengthen pattern recognition, while rejections help eliminate false positives.

**Impact Network Output Schema:**
```json
{
  "generated_at": "2025-01-15T14:32:00Z",

## 🤖 Cass Integration: AI Session Correlation (Optional)

`bw` optionally integrates with [**cass**](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass) (Claude Agent Session Store)—a tool that captures and indexes coding sessions from AI assistants like Claude. When cass is installed, `bw` automatically enhances its correlation capabilities with session-based insights.

### How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    %%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#e8f5e9', 'lineColor': '#90a4ae'}}}%%

    CASS["🤖 cass<br/><small>Session Store</small>"]
    BV["⚡ bv<br/><small>Issue Viewer</small>"]
    CORR["🔗 Enhanced<br/>Correlation"]

    CASS --> BV
    BV --> CORR

    classDef tool fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#90caf9,stroke-width:2px
    class CASS,BV,CORR tool
```

**Graceful Degradation:** If cass is not installed, `bw` works normally—no errors, broken UI, or loading states. Cass features simply become unavailable.

### Detection & Status

`bw` automatically detects cass on startup:

| Status | Indicator | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Healthy** | 🤖 in status bar | cass is installed, indexed, and ready |
| **Needs Index** | ⚠️ in status bar | cass installed but needs `cass index` |
| **Not Installed** | (none) | cass not in PATH—features hidden |

### Installing Cass

```bash
# Install cass (see https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass for full docs)
brew install dicklesworthstone/tap/cass   # macOS
# or
cargo install cass                         # From source

# Index your coding sessions
cass index

# Verify integration
bw  # Look for 🤖 in status bar
```

### Cass-Enhanced History View

When cass is available, the History View gains additional capabilities:

- **Session Timeline**: `V` key shows sessions alongside commits
- **Agent Attribution**: See which AI assistant contributed to changes
- **Enhanced Search**: Search across both commits and sessions

### Burndown Calculation

The burndown chart implements a **scope-aware algorithm** that tracks not just completion velocity but also scope changes:

1. **Ideal Burn Rate:** `Total Beads / Sprint Duration`
2. **Actual Burn Rate:** `Closed Beads / Days Elapsed`
3. **Scope Events:** Added/removed beads create discontinuities in the ideal line

When beads are added mid-sprint, the burndown recalculates the ideal trajectory from that point forward, providing a realistic view of progress rather than a misleading "behind schedule" indicator.

### At-Risk Detection

Items are flagged as at-risk based on multiple heuristics:

| Signal | Threshold | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Blocked Duration** | > 2 days | Dependency bottleneck |
| **No Activity** | > 4 days | Potentially stuck or forgotten |
| **High Priority Blocked** | P0/P1 blocked | Critical path impediment |
| **Dependencies Not Closing** | Blockers still open | Cascading delay risk |

### Robot Commands

```bash
bw --robot-sprint-list                # List all sprints
bw --robot-sprint-show sprint-1       # Details for specific sprint
bw --robot-burndown current           # Burndown for active sprint
bw --robot-burndown sprint-1          # Burndown for specific sprint

### Health Score Calculation

The label health score combines multiple factors:

$$
\text{Health} = 1 - \left( w_1 \cdot \frac{\text{Blocked}}{\text{Open}} + w_2 \cdot \frac{\text{Stale}}{\text{Open}} + w_3 \cdot (1 - \text{VelocityScore}) \right)
$$

| Component | Weight | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Blocked Ratio** | 0.4 | High blocked count indicates bottlenecks |
| **Stale Ratio** | 0.3 | Stale issues suggest neglect |
| **Velocity Inverse** | 0.3 | Low throughput indicates capacity issues |

### Health Levels

| Level | Score Range | Indicator | Action |
|-------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Critical** | 0.0 – 0.4 | 🔴 | Immediate attention required |
| **Warning** | 0.4 – 0.7 | 🟡 | Monitor closely |
| **Healthy** | 0.7 – 1.0 | 🟢 | On track |

### Robot Commands for Label Analysis

**`--robot-label-health`**: Per-label health metrics
```bash
bw --robot-label-health
bw --robot-label-health | jq '.results.labels[] | select(.health_level == "critical")'
```

**`--robot-label-flow`**: Cross-label dependency flow matrix
```bash
bw --robot-label-flow
bw --robot-label-flow | jq '.flow.bottleneck_labels'
```

**`--robot-label-attention`**: Attention-ranked labels for prioritization
```bash
bw --robot-label-attention --attention-limit=5
```

### Label-Scoped Analysis

Use `--label` to scope any robot command to a specific label's subgraph:

```bash
bw --robot-insights --label api    # Graph metrics for api-labeled issues only
bw --robot-plan --label backend    # Execution plan for backend domain
bw --robot-priority --label auth   # Priority recommendations for auth work
```

This enables **domain isolation**: analyze and plan within a bounded context rather than the entire project graph.

### Flow Matrix: Cross-Label Dependencies

The flow matrix reveals how labels depend on each other:

```
          → api  → auth  → ui   → docs
api         -      3       2      0
auth        1      -       0      1
ui          4      2       -      0
docs        0      0       0      -
```

Read as: "api has 3 issues that depend on auth issues." High values indicate coupling between domains; the `bottleneck_labels` field highlights labels that block the most cross-domain work.

## 🌐 Static Site Export: Shareable Dashboards

`bw` can generate **self-contained static websites** for sharing project status with stakeholders who don't have terminal access.

### Interactive Wizard

```bash
bw --pages
```

Launches an interactive wizard that guides you through:
1. **Export**: Generate the static bundle
2. **Preview**: Local server at `http://localhost:9000` (or next available port)
3. **Deploy**: Push to GitHub Pages with automatic repository creation

### Direct Export

```bash
bw --export-pages ./bv-pages                    # Export to directory
bw --export-pages ./bv-pages --pages-title "Sprint 42 Status"
bw --export-pages ./bv-pages --pages-exclude-closed   # Omit closed issues
bw --export-pages ./bv-pages --pages-exclude-history  # Omit git history

# Preview an existing bundle without regenerating
bw --preview-pages ./bv-pages                   # Serve at localhost:9000 (or next available port)
```

### Optional: Hybrid Search WASM Scorer

For very large datasets, you can build an optional WASM scorer used by the static viewer.

```bash
# Build once (requires wasm-pack)
./scripts/build_hybrid_wasm.sh

# Or build during export
BW_BUILD_HYBRID_WASM=1 bv --export-pages ./bv-pages
```

If the `wasm/` assets are missing, the viewer automatically falls back to the JS scorer.

### What Gets Generated

```
./bv-pages/
├── index.html              # Main dashboard with Alpine.js + Tailwind
├── beads.sqlite3           # Full SQLite database (~2MB for 400+ issues)
├── data/
│   ├── graph_layout.json   # Pre-computed positions + metrics (~82KB)
│   ├── meta.json           # Export metadata
│   ├── triage.json         # Triage recommendations
│   └── history.json        # Bead-commit correlation data
└── vendor/
    ├── d3.v7.min.js        # Visualization library
    ├── force-graph.min.js  # Graph rendering
    └── bv_graph.js         # WASM graph engine
```

### Graph Visualization: 16x Faster Render

The export uses a **hybrid architecture** for instant graph loading:

| Component | Size | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `graph_layout.json` | ~82KB | Pre-computed node positions + graph metrics |
| `beads.sqlite3` | ~2MB | Full issue data for detail pane, search, tables |

**How it works:**
1. Browser loads tiny `graph_layout.json` first (~100ms over broadband)
2. Graph renders instantly with pre-computed `fx`/`fy` fixed positions
3. SQLite loads in parallel for search and detail functionality
4. Force simulation is completely bypassed—no jittering, no layout delay

**Performance comparison:**

| Metric | Without Pre-compute | With Pre-compute |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| Initial load | 4+ seconds | ~250ms |
| Force simulation | 2+ seconds | 0ms (skipped) |
| Graph data | 914KB (redundant) | 82KB (compact) |

### Detail Pane

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Detail pane includes:**
- Full issue title and description (markdown rendered)
- Priority, type, status with visual indicators
- **Blockers count** ("⛔ 3 blockers")—issues that must complete first
- **Blocks count** ("📤 blocks 5 issues")—downstream work waiting on this
- PageRank, betweenness metrics (from pre-computed data)

### Features

- **Full-Text Search**: SQLite FTS5 powers instant search across all issue titles and descriptions. Results appear as you type—no server required.
- **Interactive Graph**: Visualize dependencies with D3.js force-graph, featuring zoom, pan, and node selection
- **Detail Pane**: Click any node to see full issue details with dependency info
- **Triage View**: Same recommendations as `--robot-triage`
- **Offline Support**: Works without network after initial load
- **Mobile Responsive**: Adapts to phone/tablet screens with touch-friendly interactions

### Technical Notes

The static export uses a **hybrid architecture** combining:

1. **Pure-Go SQLite** ([modernc.org/sqlite](https://modernc.org/sqlite)):
   - No C compiler required—works on any system without CGO
   - Cross-platform bundle generation
   - FTS5 full-text search built-in

2. **Pre-computed Graph Layout**:
   - BFS hierarchical layout with depth-based X positioning
   - Node positions stored as `[x, y]` pairs
   - Metrics stored as compact 5-element arrays: `[pagerank, betweenness, inDegree, outDegree, inCycle]`
   - ~91% size reduction vs. full graph JSON

3. **WASM Graph Engine** (`bv_graph.js`):
   - Client-side cycle detection
   - Efficient neighbor lookups
   - Path finding for blocker chains

### Deployment Options

| Platform | Command | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **GitHub Pages** | `bw --pages` (wizard) | Auto-creates `gh-pages` branch |
| **Cloudflare Pages** | `bw --export-pages ./dist` + CF dashboard | Connect to git repo |
| **Any Static Host** | `bw --export-pages ./dist` | Netlify, Vercel, S3, etc. |

## 🚨 Alerts System: Proactive Health Monitoring

The Alerts System surfaces potential problems before they become blockers. It combines **drift detection** (changes from baseline) with **proactive analysis** (pattern-based warnings).

### Alert Types

| Type | Trigger | Severity | Example |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| `stale_issue` | No updates in 30+ days | Warning | "BV-123 hasn't been touched since Oct 15" |
| `blocking_cascade` | Issue blocks 5+ others | Critical | "AUTH-001 is blocking 8 downstream tasks" |
| `priority_mismatch` | Low priority but high PageRank | Warning | "BV-456 has P3 but ranks #2 in PageRank" |
| `cycle_introduced` | New circular dependency | Critical | "Cycle detected: A → B → C → A" |
| `scope_creep` | 20%+ increase in open issues | Info | "Open issues grew from 45 to 58 this week" |

### TUI Integration

Press `!` to open the **Alerts Panel**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

## 🤖 Complete CLI Reference
## 🏢 Multi-Repository Workspace Support

For monorepo and multi-package architectures, `bw` provides **workspace configuration** that unifies issues across multiple repositories into a single coherent view.

### Workspace Configuration (`.bv/workspace.yaml`)

```yaml
# .bv/workspace.yaml - Multi-repo workspace definition
name: my-workspace

repos:
  - name: api
    path: services/api
    prefix: "api-"        # Issues become api-AUTH-123
    beads_path: .beads    # Optional per-repo override (defaults to .beads)

  - name: web
    path: apps/web
    prefix: "web-"        # Issues become web-UI-456

  - name: shared
    path: packages/shared
    prefix: "lib-"        # Issues become lib-UTIL-789

discovery:
  enabled: true
  patterns:
    - "*"                 # Direct children
    - "packages/*"        # npm/pnpm workspaces
    - "apps/*"            # Next.js/Turborepo
    - "services/*"        # Microservices
    - "libs/*"            # Library packages
  exclude:
    - node_modules
    - vendor
    - .git
  max_depth: 2

defaults:
  beads_path: .beads      # Where to find beads.jsonl in each repo
```

### ID Namespacing

When working across repositories, issues are automatically namespaced:

| Local ID | Repo Prefix | Namespaced ID |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `AUTH-123` | `api-` | `api-AUTH-123` |
| `UI-456` | `web-` | `web-UI-456` |
| `UTIL-789` | `lib-` | `lib-UTIL-789` |

### Cross-Repository Dependencies

The workspace system enables **cross-repo blocking relationships**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  web-UI-456 (apps/web)                                  │
│  "Implement OAuth login page"                           │
│                                                         │
│  blocks: api-AUTH-123, lib-UTIL-789                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         │                      │
         ▼                      ▼
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│ api-AUTH-123    │    │ lib-UTIL-789    │
│ (services/api)  │    │ (packages/lib)  │
│ "Auth endpoint" │    │ "Token utils"   │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### Filtering Within a Workspace

Use `--repo` to scope the view (and robot outputs) to a specific repository prefix. Matching is case-insensitive and accepts common separators (`-`, `:`, `_`); it also honors the `source_repo` field when present.

### Supported Monorepo Layouts

| Layout | Pattern | Example Projects |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **npm/pnpm workspaces** | `packages/*` | Lerna, Turborepo |
| **Next.js apps** | `apps/*` | Vercel monorepos |
| **Microservices** | `services/*` | Backend platforms |
| **Go modules** | `modules/*` | Multi-module Go |
| **Flat** | `*` | Simple monorepos |

### ID Resolution

The `IDResolver` handles cross-repo references intelligently:

```go
resolver := NewIDResolver(config, "api")

// From api repo context:
resolver.Resolve("AUTH-123")      // → {Namespace: "api-", LocalID: "AUTH-123"}
resolver.Resolve("web-UI-456")    // → {Namespace: "web-", LocalID: "UI-456"}
resolver.IsCrossRepo("web-UI-456") // → true
resolver.DisplayID("api-AUTH-123") // → "AUTH-123" (local, strip prefix)
resolver.DisplayID("web-UI-456")   // → "web-UI-456" (cross-repo, keep prefix)
```

## ⏰ Interactive Time-Travel Mode

Beyond CLI diff commands, `bw` supports **interactive time-travel** within the TUI itself. This mode overlays diff badges on your issue list, letting you visually explore what changed.

### Activating Time-Travel Mode

Press `t` in the main list view to enter time-travel mode with a custom revision prompt:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⏱️  Time-Travel Mode                    │
│                                          │
│  Compare current state with a            │
│  historical revision                     │
│                                          │
│  ⏱️  Revision: HEAD~5█                   │
│                                          │
│  Examples: HEAD~5, main, v1.0.0,         │
│           2024-01-01, abc123             │
│                                          │
│  Press Enter to compare, Esc to cancel   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For quick access, press `T` (uppercase) to instantly compare against `HEAD~5` without the prompt.

### Diff Badges

Once activated, issues display visual badges indicating their diff status:

| Badge | Meaning | Color |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `[NEW]` | Issue created since baseline | Green |
| `[CLOSED]` | Issue closed since baseline | Gray |
| `[MODIFIED]` | Issue fields changed | Yellow |
| `[REOPENED]` | Issue reopened since baseline | Orange |

### Visual Example

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📋 ISSUES (since HEAD~5)                          58 total │

## 🧪 Quality Assurance & Robustness
## 🔄 The Zero-Friction Update Engine

`bw` includes a proactive, non-intrusive update check to ensure you never miss a feature. We believe tools should maintain themselves without interrupting your flow.

### Design & Implementation
The updater (`pkg/updater/updater.go`) is architected for silence and safety:
1.  **Non-Blocking Concurrency:** The check runs in a detached goroutine with a strict **2-second timeout**. It never delays your startup time or UI interactivity.
2.  **Semantic Versioning:** It doesn't just match strings. A custom SemVer comparator ensures you are only notified about strictly *newer* releases, handling complex edge cases like release candidates vs. stable builds.
3.  **Resilience:** It gracefully handles network partitions, GitHub API rate limits (403/429), and timeouts by silently failing. You will never see a crash or error log due to an update check.
4.  **Unobtrusive Notification:** When an update is found, `bw` doesn't pop a modal. It simply renders a subtle **Update Available** indicator (`⭐`) in the footer, letting you choose when to upgrade.

---

## 🗂️ Data Loading & Self-Healing

Reliability is key. `bw` doesn't assume a perfect environment; it actively handles common file system inconsistencies.

### 1. Intelligent Path Discovery
The loader (`pkg/loader/loader.go`) doesn't just blindly open `.beads/beads.jsonl`. It employs a priority-based discovery algorithm:
1.  **Canonical:** Checks for `issues.jsonl` (preferred by beads upstream).
2.  **Legacy:** Fallback to `beads.jsonl` for backward compatibility.
3.  **Base:** Checks `beads.base.jsonl` (used by `bd` in daemon mode).
4.  **Validation:** It skips temporary files like `*.backup` or `deletions.jsonl` to prevent displaying corrupted state.

### 2. Robust Parsing
The JSONL parser is designed to be **Lossy-Tolerant**.
*   It uses a buffered scanner (`bufio.NewScanner`) with a generous 10MB line limit to handle massive description blobs.
*   Malformed lines (e.g., from a merge conflict) are skipped with a warning rather than crashing the application, ensuring you can still view the readable parts of your project even during a bad git merge.

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: My icons look weird / text is misaligned.**
*   `bw` requires a terminal with **TrueColor** support and a **Nerd Font** installed.
*   *Recommended:* [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (e.g., "JetBrains Mono Nerd Font" or "Hack Nerd Font").
*   *Terminals:* Windows Terminal, iTerm2, Alacritty, Kitty, WezTerm.

**Q: Live reload isn’t updating (especially on NFS/SMB/SSHFS/FUSE).**
*   Some filesystems don’t reliably deliver filesystem events. `bw` will try to auto-detect this and switch to polling.
*   If it still misbehaves, force polling:
    ```bash
    BW_FORCE_POLLING=1 bv
    # or
    BW_FORCE_POLL=1 bv
    ```

**Q: I see `polling …` in the footer. Is that bad?**
No — it just means `bw` is using polling instead of filesystem events for live reload (common on remote filesystems). Polling can add a small delay before updates appear.

**Q: I see `⚠ STALE` / `✗ bg …` / `⚠ worker unresponsive` / `↻ recovered` in the footer.**
These indicators mean the background worker hasn’t produced a fresh snapshot recently (or needed to self-heal). Try `Ctrl+R`/`F5`, check filesystem permissions/health, or temporarily disable background mode (`BW_BACKGROUND_MODE=0`) to fall back to synchronous reload.

**Q: I see "Cycles Detected" in the dashboard. What now?**
A: A cycle (e.g., A → B → A) means your project logic is broken; no task can be finished first. Use the Insights Dashboard (`i`) to find the specific cycle members, then use `bd` to remove one of the dependency links (e.g., `bd unblock A --from B`).

**Q: Does this work with Jira/GitHub?**
A: `bw` is data-agnostic. The Beads data schema supports an `external_ref` field. If you populate your `.beads/beads.jsonl` file with issues from external trackers (e.g., using a custom script or sync tool), `bw` will render them alongside your local tasks. Future versions of the `bd` CLI may support native syncing, but `bw` is ready for that data today.

**Q: What's the difference between "bead" and "issue"?**
A: They're the same thing! In the Beads ecosystem, the unit of work is called a "bead" (hence the name). However, `bw` uses "issue" in many places since that's the more familiar term for most developers. The CLI flags use both interchangeably: `--robot-file-beads`, `--pages-include-closed` (issues), etc. Think of "bead" as the Beads-specific term and "issue" as the general concept.

## 🛠️ Configuration

`bw` automatically detects your terminal capabilities to render the best possible UI. It looks for `.beads/beads.jsonl` in your current directory.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `BEADS_DIR` | Custom beads directory path. When set, overrides the default `.beads` directory lookup. | `.beads` in cwd |
| `BW_BACKGROUND_MODE` | Experimental: enable background snapshot loading for live reload in the TUI (`1`/`0`). | (disabled) |
| `BW_FORCE_POLLING` | Force polling-based live reload (useful on NFS/SMB/SSHFS/FUSE or any setup where filesystem events are unreliable) (`1`/`0`). | (auto) |
| `BW_FORCE_POLL` | Alias for `BW_FORCE_POLLING`. | (auto) |
| `BW_DEBOUNCE_MS` | Debounce window (milliseconds) for live reload events in background mode. | `200` |
| `BW_CHANNEL_BUFFER` | Background worker message buffer size (worker → UI). | `8` |
| `BW_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_S` | Background worker heartbeat interval (seconds). | `5` |
| `BW_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_S` | Background worker watchdog interval (seconds). | `10` |
| `BW_FRESHNESS_WARN_S` | Snapshot staleness warning threshold (seconds). | `30` |
| `BW_FRESHNESS_STALE_S` | Snapshot staleness critical threshold (seconds). | `120` |
| `BW_MAX_LINE_SIZE_MB` | Max JSONL line size in MB (lines larger than this are skipped with a warning). | `10` |
| `BW_SKIP_PHASE2` | Skip Phase 2 graph metrics (centrality, cycles, critical path) (`1`/`0`). | (disabled) |
| `BW_PHASE2_TIMEOUT_S` | Override per-metric Phase 2 timeouts (seconds). | (size-based) |
| `BW_SEMANTIC_EMBEDDER` | Semantic embedding provider for `bw --search` and TUI semantic mode. | `hash` |
| `BW_SEMANTIC_DIM` | Embedding dimension for semantic search index. | `384` |
| `BW_SEMANTIC_MODEL` | Provider-specific model name for semantic search (optional). | (empty) |

**Use cases for `BEADS_DIR`:**
- **Monorepos**: Single beads directory shared across multiple packages
- **Non-standard layouts**: Projects where `.beads` isn't in the working directory
- **Testing**: Point to test fixtures without changing directory
- **Cross-directory access**: View beads from anywhere on the filesystem

```bash
# Example: Point to a different beads directory
BEADS_DIR=/path/to/shared/beads bv

# Example: Use in monorepo
export BEADS_DIR=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.beads
```

### Experimental: Background Mode (Live Reload)

The TUI can run live reload using an **experimental background snapshot worker** (moves file I/O + analysis off the UI thread).

**Enable (opt-in):**
```bash
BW_BACKGROUND_MODE=1 bv
bw --background-mode
```

**Disable / rollback:**
```bash
BW_BACKGROUND_MODE=0 bv
bw --no-background-mode
```

**User config file (when neither CLI flags nor `BW_BACKGROUND_MODE` are set):**
```yaml
# ~/.config/bv/config.yaml
experimental:
  background_mode: true
```

**Precedence:** CLI flags → `BW_BACKGROUND_MODE` → `~/.config/bv/config.yaml`.

**Migration plan (high level):**
- Phase A (now): opt-in background mode, sync remains default.
- Phase B: broaden rollout; keep explicit rollback (`--no-background-mode` / `BW_BACKGROUND_MODE=0`).
- Phase C: flip default when stable; keep sync as fallback for a period.
- Phase D: remove legacy sync reload path after deprecation window.

**Monitoring plan:** no automatic telemetry today; rely on CI + regression tests and user reports during Phase A/B.

### Status Indicators (Background Mode + Live Reload)

When background mode or live reload is enabled, the footer may display these indicators:

- `◌ metrics…` — Phase 2 metrics are still computing; the UI renders immediately with Phase 1 data.
- `⚠ 45s ago` — snapshot age warning (data is getting stale).
- `⚠ STALE: 3m ago` — snapshot is stale.
- `✗ bg <phase> (3x)` — background worker hit repeated errors building snapshots (phase shown; retry count in parentheses).
- `↻ recovered xN` — watchdog recovered the background worker N times (transient failures/self-healing).
- `⚠ worker unresponsive` — watchdog detected the worker is stuck and is recovering.
- `polling …` — live reload is using polling instead of filesystem events (common on remote filesystems); changes may appear with a small delay.

Tip: `Ctrl+R` (or `F5`) forces a refresh.

### Visual Theme
The UI uses a visually distinct, high-contrast theme inspired by Dracula Principles to ensure readability.
*   **Primary:** `#BD93F9` (Purple)
*   **Status Open:** `#50FA7B` (Green)
*   **Status Blocked:** `#FF5555` (Red)
